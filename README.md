# TFidfVectorizer-search-engine-Project-Gutenberg
'''
My program runs in Jupyter Notebook. Before running, make sure you have the following packages installed: WordCloud, urllib, re, pandas, nltk, lumpy, nltk.stem, nltk.corpus, sklearn.feature_extraction.text, sklearn.metrics.pairwise, and matplotlib.
Also, use the attached â€˜Gutenberg_TextFileHTMLs.csv' and upload that to your home directory. The rest of the code should run smoothly. 
There are 5 functions that need user input. They will ask for titles of books. Please copy/paste titles from the Title List since it needs an exact match to run.
Thank you!
